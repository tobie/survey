* Open source programs are very critical or extremely critical to the success of engineering and product teams according to 59% of respondents. 
* The top three benefits of managing an open source program are awareness of open source usage/dependencies, increased developer agility/speed, and better license compliance.
* Large companies are about twice as likely to run an open source program than smaller companies (63 percent vs. 37 percent).
* Open source programs tend to start informally as a working group or a few key open source developers and then evolve into formal programs over time, typically within a companyâ€™s software engineering or development department (about 41 percent of programs).
* The benefits of an open source program are widely known, with 70% of those without a program believing it would have a positive impact in their company, despite any barriers to creating it.
